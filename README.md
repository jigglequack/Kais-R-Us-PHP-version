index.css is for the navigation bar at the top.
1. about.html and about.css. Displays my personal information and what the store is about. Includes all of the
	links of css design that I took from to enhance fancier look.
2. HomePage.html and store.css. 12 items are shown because I liked even grids. Each panel is expandable on hover.	
3. HomePage.html and store.css. Each item has an image.
4. HomePage.html and store.css (Hover over items for bigger picture and more info. Clicking on it redirects to a detail page.)
5. desc.html and desc.css. Form is on the right.
6. desc.html and desc.css. Sends all of the information in a mailto using pattern match.
7. desc.html and desc.css (lots of "Required" and "pattern" to check the input)
8. desc.html and desc.css
9. All the css files. I'm probably most proud of the "extra images" and how hovering them replaces the bigger image.
10. HomePage.html and store.css. Hovering over the image on the store page increases image size.
11. about.html and about.css (The sources for designs and pictures taken are there too.)
